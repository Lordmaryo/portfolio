              My name is Emmanuel Ofoneta, and I’m based in Lagos, Nigeria. I’m
              a software developer with a passion for building both frontend and
              backend technologies. My journey in tech has been shaped by a love
              for learning and solving problems, always striving to improve my
              skills and grow with every project I take on.

              My Background in Software Development
            </h2>
            <p className="pb-4">
              I stumbled upon coding during the lockdown, which turned out to be
              a life changing decision. At first, I began by creating simple
              frontend websites, which quickly turned into a passion, this
              realization fueled me to go deeper into programming, and I decided
              to make it a profession. From those early days of building small
              personal projects, I transitioned into professional work, learning
              about the vast potential of technology.

              But I Wanted More...
            </h2>
            <p className="pb-4">
              As I grew in my development journey, I realized I wanted to
              understand more about how software truly works, especially on the
              backend. I wasn’t just satisfied with creating websites, I wanted
              to know how they function under the hood. This led me to go into
              backend development and the workings of web applications. I
              learned about server-side technologies, databases, and APIs, and
              how they all tie into creating seamless and efficient digital
              experiences. This deeper understanding has allowed me to work on
              complex systems and build, scalable applications that power modern
              platforms.
